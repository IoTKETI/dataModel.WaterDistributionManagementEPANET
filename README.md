# dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement
These data models describe entities useful for dealing with Water Network Management data. These entities are primarily derived from the EPANET platform.

The following entity types are available:
- [Curve](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement/Curve/README.md
). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic curve made for
the Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated
with the water management vertical and related IoT applications.


- [Junction](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement/Junction/README.md
). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic junction made for
the Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated
with the water network management vertical and related IoT applications.


- [Pattern](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement/Pattern/README.md
). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic pattern made for
the Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated
with the water management vertical and related IoT applications.


- [Pipe](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement/Pipe/README.md
). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic pipe made for the
Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated with
the water management vertical and related IoT applications.


- [Pump](https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement/Pump/README.md
). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic pump made for the
Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated with
