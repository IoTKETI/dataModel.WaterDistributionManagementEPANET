# Water Network Management Harmonized Data Models

## Description
These data models describe entities useful for dealing with Water Network Management data. These entities are primarily derived from the EPANET platform. 

The main entities identified are:

-   [Curve](./Curve/doc/spec.md). It defines data curves and their X,Y points.
-   [Junction](./Junction/doc/spec.md). It represents junction nodes contained in the network
-   [Pattern](./Pattern/doc/spec.md). It represents time patterns.
-   [Pipe](./Pipe/doc/spec.md). It represents all pipe links contained in the network.
-   [Pump](./Pump/doc/spec.md). It represents all pump links contained in the network.
-   [Reservoir](./Reservoir/doc/spec.md). It represents all reservoir nodes contained in the network.
-   [Tank](./Tank/doc/spec.md). It represents all tank nodes contained in the network.
-   [Valve](./Valve/doc/spec.md). It represents all control valve links contained in the network.
