# dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement
These data models describe entities useful for dealing with Water Network Management data. These entities are primarily derived from the EPANET platform.

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [Curve](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement/blob/master/Curve/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic curve made for
the Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated
with the water management vertical and related IoT applications.


- [Junction](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WaterNetworkManagement/blob/master/Junction/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic junction made for
the Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated
