    This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Valve made for
    the Water Network Management domain. This entity is primarily associated
    with the water management vertical and related IoT applications.
  properties:

        type: Property
      type: object
      description: |
        The valve diameter. All units are accepted in [CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact.html) code

        type: Relationship
      type: object
      description: |
        The ID of the node on the nominal downstream or discharge side of the valve.
        Reference to an entity of type `Node (Reservoir, Junction, Tank)`
    initialStatus:
      x-ngsi:
        type: Property
      type: object
      description: |
        Valve status at the start of the simulation. If set to OPEN or CLOSED then the control setting of the valve is ignored and the valve behaves as an open or closed link, respectively. 
        If set to NONE, then the valve will behave as intended.
        Values are resrtricted to: "OPEN","CLOSED","NONE".
    minorLoss:
      x-ngsi:
        type: Property
      type: object
      description: |
        Unitless minor loss coefficient that applies when the valve is completely opened.
         All units are accepted in [CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact.html) code.
    setting:
      x-ngsi:
        type: Property
      type: object
      description: |
        A parameter that describes the valve's operational setting.
